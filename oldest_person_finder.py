# Create a dictionary to store user's input
# Create a loop for the name
    # Create a loop for the age, inside the first loop
    # Create a loop for the retry confirmation
    # Ask if the user wants to input another entry using a variable, if not, break the loop
# Create oldest_name and oldest_age variables, store the first input of the user (index 0)
# Compare the age in oldest_age to the current age (new entry)
    # If the new information/input is greater than the age in oldest_age variable, update oldest_age and oldest_name
    #Print the oldest person using a function that will print the oldest_name and oldest_age
