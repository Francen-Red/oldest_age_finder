1. Use an array specifically dictionary to store the user's input.
2. Use loops for name and another one for age, since it should follow a valid format.
3. Store the inputted information in the dictionary.
4. Create a loop that will ask the user if they would like to retry the input for the name, age, or both.
5. If "yes", break the loop. If "no", then prompt the user to retry the name, age, or both.
6. After confirming the entry, ask the user if they want to input another information.
If yes, loop through the past loops again. If no, proceed to comparison of age.
7. Make oldest_name and oldest_age variables, store the first input of the user. 
8. Compare oldest_age to the current input. If the current age is greater than oldest_age, 
update oldest_age and set oldest_name to the current name corresponding to it.
9. Display the oldest person's name and age.
